    Overview
    ~~~~~~~~

    An M-to-N crossbar that spreads a contiguous address range across
    ``nb_slaves`` banks at a fixed interleaving granularity, and lets
    up to ``nb_masters`` masters issue requests into that range. It is a
    **timed, round-robin arbiter**, not a zero-latency shuffle:

    - **Input side (async ``io_v2``).** A request arriving in the
      idle state is ``DENIED``; the crossbar records *which* input
      wants *which* bank in one bit of ``banks[bank_id].pending_mask``
      and arms a ``ClockEvent`` for the same cycle. The fsm raises an
      ``in_election`` flag, round-robin picks one winner per bank from
      the pending bitmask and calls ``retry()`` on it. Any request
      landing on the input port while the flag is raised (typically
      the retried master's synchronous re-issue) is forwarded inline
      to its bank instead of being denied. Two masters contending for
      the same bank are serialised across cycles. No request pointer
      is ever stored.
    - **Output side (:class:`IoV2Sync`).** The bank answers every request
      inline with ``IO_REQ_DONE`` and never uses the async ``resp()`` /
      ``retry()`` channel, so the inline forward returns DONE to the
      master in the same call — **no in-flight tracking, no async
      routing, no bank-stall handling**. Binds only to a sync slave such
      as ``memory.memory_v3``.

    Address decoding
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The crossbar expects the input address to already be relative to
    its own region — the upstream router (or a per-master remapper)
    must strip any base before the request reaches the LogIco. Given
    such an address ``addr``, the crossbar computes:

    .. code-block:: text

        slave_bits  = ceil_log2(nb_slaves)
        bank_id     = (addr >> interleaving_width) & (nb_slaves - 1)
        bank_offset = ((addr >> (slave_bits + interleaving_width)) << interleaving_width)
                      | (addr & ((1 << interleaving_width) - 1))

    The address delivered to the bank is ``bank_offset`` — the bank
    sees a compacted local address space starting at 0. Concretely,
    bits in the address play these roles:

    .. code-block:: text

        | high bits ... | bank_id (slave_bits) | granule bits (interleaving_width) |
                 |_________|     selector     |__________________________________|
                     |                                        |
                     +---- moved down, shifted left by        +---- kept in place, becomes
                           interleaving_width, into the             the low part of the bank
                           bank_offset high part                    local address

    Worked example
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ``nb_slaves = 4`` (``slave_bits = 2``), ``interleaving_width = 4``
    (16-byte granules). Address ``0x0A34`` (already region-relative):

    - binary: ``0000_1010_0011_0100``
    - granule bits [3:0] = ``0100`` → low 4 bits of bank-local addr
    - bank selector [5:4] = ``11`` → bank ``3``
    - high bits [11:6] = ``101000`` → bank-local high part
    - bank-local address = ``(101000 << 4) | 0100`` = ``0x284``

    So byte ``0x0A34`` of the global range is served by bank ``3`` at
    its local offset ``0x284``.

    Memory map properties:

    - Bytes ``0`` .. ``(1 << interleaving_width) - 1`` all go to
      bank ``0`` at local addresses ``0`` .. ``(1 << interleaving_width) - 1``.
    - The next ``(1 << interleaving_width)`` bytes go to bank ``1`` at
      the same local addresses, and so on.
    - After ``nb_slaves`` granules the cycle repeats, incremented by
      one granule in each bank's local address space.

    Request flow
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - **Incoming request** (``input_req``): decode the bank from the
      address. If ``in_election`` is set (the fsm is currently
      dispatching retries), forward inline to the bank and return
      ``IO_REQ_DONE``. Otherwise set bit ``id`` in
      ``banks[bank_id].pending_mask``, arm the fsm with zero delay,
      and return ``DENIED``. The crossbar never holds onto the request
      pointer — the master is expected to re-issue when retried.
    - **Arbiter tick** (``fsm_handler``): raise the ``in_election``
      flag; for each bank with a non-empty mask, find the first set
      bit at-or-after the bank's round-robin cursor (rotate +
      ``ctz``), clear it, and call ``retry()`` on the winner. The
      master's retry handler synchronously re-issues; the re-issue
      hits ``input_req`` with the flag still raised and is forwarded
      inline to the (IoV2Sync) bank for an inline ``IO_REQ_DONE``.
      After the loop the flag drops; the fsm re-arms for the next
      cycle if any bank still has pending bits, so each bank serves
      at most one master per cycle.

    Because the output is synchronous there is no GRANTED/DENIED/retry
    path from the bank, and because the input always defers via the
    retry handshake the crossbar never owns an in-flight request.

    Timing model
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The crossbar arbitrates **one master per bank per cycle**. Cross-bank
    requests proceed in parallel within a tick; same-bank requests
    serialise across ticks. The crossbar adds no latency of its own
    beyond this arbitration throughput; any per-access cost (fixed
    latency, bandwidth) is modelled by the bank and surfaced via the
    inline ``req->latency`` annotation the master reads on response.

    Ports
    ~~~~~

    - **input_0 .. input_{M-1}** (slave, ``io_v2``, muxed) — one per
      master. ``M = nb_masters``. Async contract: every fresh request
      is ``DENIED``, and the master is later ``retry()``-ed by the
      arbiter — re-issuing then completes inline as ``DONE``.
    - **output_0 .. output_{N-1}** (master, :class:`IoV2Sync`, muxed) —
      one per bank. ``N = nb_slaves``. Each output receives requests
      whose bank selector bits equal its index, with the address
      rewritten to bank-local form, and must answer inline.

    The port methods :meth:`i_INPUT` and :meth:`o_OUTPUT` take an
    ``id`` argument to name the specific port.

    Constraints and limitations
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - **``nb_masters`` is capped at 64.** ``pending_mask`` is a
      ``uint64_t``; building a LogIco with more masters trips a
      vp_assert at construction.
    - **``nb_slaves`` should be a power of two for clean decode.** The
      decode uses ``(1 << slave_bits) - 1`` as the bank-id mask; with
      non-power-of-two ``nb_slaves``, a subset of bank-id values
      would map onto valid banks while the rest would index out of
      range. No runtime check is performed — it is the caller's
      responsibility.
    - **``interleaving_width`` must be non-negative.** A value of 0
      degenerates to *byte-level* interleaving — every byte goes to a
      different bank. Valid but usually not what you want; set it to
      the log2 of the granule size you actually want.
    - **Requests must not straddle a bank boundary.** The crossbar
      samples the bank selector once from the base address and
      forwards the whole request to that bank. A request that crosses
      a granule boundary delivers bytes beyond the granule to the
      wrong place inside the bank. Upstreams must keep each request
      within a single granule (``addr % (1 << iw) + size <= (1 << iw)``).
    - **Round-robin arbitration, one master per bank per cycle.** Two
      masters contending for the *same* bank are served on successive
      ticks; the rotor advances each tick a forward succeeded, so no
      master is starved. Masters targeting *different* banks are served
      in the same tick.
    - **Synchronous bank required.** The output is :class:`IoV2Sync`; a
      bank that returns ``GRANTED``/``DENIED`` or drives ``resp()`` /
      ``retry()`` violates the contract and is fatal at run time. Bind a
      sync slave such as ``memory.memory_v3.Memory``.
    - **Fixed topology at build time.** ``nb_masters``, ``nb_slaves``,
      ``interleaving_width`` are read once. Runtime reconfiguration is
      not supported.
    - **Address rewrite is not reversed.** The request object keeps the
      bank-local address after the forward; a master that re-reads
      ``req->addr`` after completion sees the bank-local value.

    Configuration fields
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    All crossbar parameters live on :class:`LogIcoConfig`. Values are
    read once at construction; no runtime reconfiguration.

    ``nb_masters``
        Number of input master ports. Must be ≥ 1. Default: ``0`` —
        must be overridden.

    ``nb_slaves``
        Number of output bank ports. Must be ≥ 1; power of two for
        a clean address decode. Default: ``0`` — must be overridden.

    ``interleaving_width``
        Log2 of the bank-local granule size, in bytes. With
        ``interleaving_width=2`` the granule is 4 bytes (word-level
        interleaving); with ``interleaving_width=6`` the granule is
        64 bytes (cache-line interleaving). Default: ``0`` (byte
        interleaving).

    Example
    ~~~~~~~

    Four masters fan in to eight banks, 32-byte interleaving. The
    upstream router maps the crossbar's region (say
    ``0x1000_0000..0x1000_xxxx``) with the default ``remove_base=True``
    so the LogIco's inputs see addresses starting at 0:

    .. code-block:: python

        xbar = LogIco(self, 'xbar', config=LogIcoConfig(
            nb_masters=4, nb_slaves=8,
            interleaving_width=5))
        for m in range(4):
            cores[m].o_DATA(xbar.i_INPUT(m))
        for s in range(8):
            xbar.o_OUTPUT(s, banks[s].i_INPUT())

    A request reaching the LogIco at offset ``0x40`` (granule-id 0x2,
    bank 2) lands on ``banks[2]`` at bank-local address 0. A
    concurrent request at offset ``0x60`` (granule 0x3, bank 3) lands
    on ``banks[3]`` at bank-local 0 in parallel — the two masters do
    not stall each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent : Component
        Parent component this crossbar is instantiated under.
    name : str
        Local name of the crossbar within ``parent``. Used for
        component path, traces, and as the lookup key for bindings.
    config : LogIcoConfig
        All crossbar parameters live here. The instance is taken over
        by the crossbar — pass a fresh :class:`LogIcoConfig` per
