 * @brief Model a memory plug
 * 
 * This memory plug is meant to be connected to a memory interface to provide high-bandwidth 
 * throughput through multiple outstanding requests.
 * It has several ports, and each port can send a single request to the memory interface.
 * It can accept multiple input requests, each request being served on one port, which means
 * multiple request has to be enqueued to increase the bandwidth.
