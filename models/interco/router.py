class Router(gvsoc.systree.Component):
    """Interconnect router

    This models an AXI-like router.
    It is capable of routing memory-mapped requests from an input port to output ports based on
    the request address.
    It has several input ports, one for each set of independent initiators, and several output
    ports, one for each target memory area.
    In terms of timing behavior, the router makes sure the flow of requests going throught it
    respects a certain bandwidth and can also apply a latency to the requests.
    This models a full crossbar, one input port can always send to an output port without being
    disturbed by other paths.
    Read and write bursts can also go through the router in parallel.
    The timing behavior can be specialized by tuning the 3 following properties:
    - The global latency. This applies the same latency to each requests injected into the router.
    - The entry latency. This applies the latency only to requests going through the output port
      to which the latency is associated.
    - The bandwidth. The router will use it to delay requests so that the amount of bytes going
      through an output repects the global bandwidth.

    The router has 2 main modes, either synchronous or asynchronous.

    The synchronous mode can be used when the simulation speed should be privileged.
    In this case the router forwards the requests as fast as possible in a synchronous way so that
    everything is handled within a function call.
    There are some rare cases where the requests will be handled asynchronously:
    - The slave where the request is forwarded handled it asynchronously
    - The request is spread accross several entries and of the slave where part of the request
      was forwarded handled the request asynchronously.
    In this mode, the router lets the requests go through it as they arrive and use the request
    latency to respect the bandwidth. If we are already above the bandwidth, the latency of the
    request, which is the starting point of the burst, is delayed to the cycle where we get under
    the bandwidth. The bandwidth is also used to set the duration of the burst.
    The bandwidth is applied first on input ports to model the fact that requests coming from same
    port are serialized, and applied a second time on output port, for the same reason.
    The drawback of this synchronous router is that any incoming request is immediately forwarded
    to an output port. This means several requests can be routed in the same cycle, even to the same
    output port. When this happens, the next slave can handle a big amount of data in the same cycle,
    which means it can block activity for some time, creating some artificial holes in the execution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent: gvsoc.systree.Component
        The parent component where this one should be instantiated.
    name: str
        The name of the component within the parent space.
    latency: int
        Global latency applied to all incoming requests. This impacts the start time of the burst.
    bandwidth: int
        Global bandwidth, in bytes per cycle, applied to all incoming request. This impacts the
        end time of the burst.
    synchronous: True if the router should use synchronous mode where all incoming requests are
        handled as far as possible in synchronous IO mode.
