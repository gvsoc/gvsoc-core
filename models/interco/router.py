class Router(gvsoc.systree.Component):
    """Interconnect router

    This models a simple interconnect.
    It has a single input port and several output ports, one for each target memory area.
    It routes incoming requests to the right output ports, depending on the address of
    the requests.
    It can apply a latency to each, either global, or depending on the output port.
    It can also apply a global bandwidth, which impacts the duration of the request.
    The timing model is based on bursts. The latency can delay the starting point of the burst,
    while the bandwidth impacts the end point of the burst.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent: gvsoc.systree.Component
        The parent component where this one should be instantiated.
    name: str
        The name of the component within the parent space.
    latency: int
        Global latency applied to all incoming requests. This impacts the start time of the burst.
    bandwidth: int
        Global bandwidth, in bytes per cycle, applied to all incoming request. This impacts the
        end time of the burst.

        The port is created with the specified name, so that the same name can be used to connect

        On top of the global latency, a latency specific to this mapping can be added when a request
        goes through this mapping.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name: str
            Name of the mapping. An interface of the same name will be created, and so a binding

        base: int

        size: int

        remove_offset: int
