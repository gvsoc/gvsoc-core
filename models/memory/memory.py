    """Memory array

    This models a simple memory model.
    It can be preloaded with initial data.
    It contains a timing model of a bandwidth, reported through latency.
    It can support riscv atomics.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent: gvsoc.systree.Component
        The parent component where this one should be instantiated.
    name: str
        The name of the component within the parent space.
    size: int
        The size of the memory in bytes.
    width_log2: int
        The log2 of the bandwidth to the memory, i.e. the number of bytes it can transfer per cycle.
        No timing model is applied if it is -1 and the memory is then having an infinite
        bandwidth.
    stim_file: str
        The path to a binary file which should be preloaded at beginning of the memory. The format
        is a raw binary, and is loaded with an fread.
    power_trigger: bool
        True if the memory should trigger power report generation based on dedicated accesses.
    align: int
        Specify a required alignment for the allocated memory used for the memory model.
    atomics: bool
        True if the memory should support riscv atomics. Since this is slowing down the model, it
        should be set to True only if needed.
    latency: int
        Specify extra latency which will be added to any incoming request.
    memcheck_id: int
        If this memory is used to track buffer overflow, this gives the global memory check id.
    memcheck_base: int
        Absolute base of memory where buffer overflow is tracked.
    memcheck_virtual_base: int
        Absolute virtual base of allocated buffers.
    memcheck_expansion_factor: int
        Extra size used to track buffer overflow.
