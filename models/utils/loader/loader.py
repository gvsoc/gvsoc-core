class ElfLoader(gvsoc.systree.Component):
    """ELF loader

    This model can be used to load an ELF binary from the workstation into a simulated memory.
    It will load the specified binary from workstation and will issues requests to the connected
    interconnect in order to write the sections into the memories, using the addresses found in the
    ELF binary.

    At the end of the loading phase, it can also set the entry to the conected target and requests
    it to start execution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent: gvsoc.systree.Component
        The parent component where this one should be instantiated.
    name: str
        The name of the component within the parent space.
    binary: str
        Path to the binary to be loaded.
    entry: int
        Address of the first instruction to be executed. If it is None, the entry will be
        taken from the binary.
