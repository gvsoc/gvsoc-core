    """Clock domain

    This model can be used to define a clock domain.\n
    This instantiates a clock generator which can then be connected to components which are
    part of the clock domain.\n
    The clock domain starts with the specified frequency and its frequency can then be dynamically
    changed through a dedicated interface, so that all components of the frequency domain
    are clocked with the new frequency.\n

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent: gvsoc.systree.Component
        The parent component where this one should be instantiated.
    name: str
        The name of the component within the parent space.
    frequency: int
        The initial frequency of the clock generator.
    factor: int
        Multiplication factor. The actual output frequency will be multiplied by this factor.
        This can be used for example to be able to schedule events on both raising
        and falling edges.
